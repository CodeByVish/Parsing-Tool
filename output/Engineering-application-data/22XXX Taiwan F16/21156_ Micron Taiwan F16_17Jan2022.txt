DESIGN BASIS
Layout is designed to accommodate Phase 2 requirements
(i.e., total capacity of 3000 m3/day including 20m3/day IPA 3.05% and HF 1.54% + 180 m3/day of IPA 6%)

[Table 1]
	Phase - 1	Phase - 2
1. Feed Capacity	2* 1000m3/day of Salix + 20m3/day IPA 3.05% and HF 1.54% + 180 m3/day of IPA 6%	Addition of 1000m3/day of Salix
2. Base Case  (Working)	Feed to ROi: 1000m3/day of Salix        (ROi recovery 80%)  Feed to NH3-IPA recovery: 190m3/day of Salix (20% ROi reject)	Feed to ROi: 2000m3/day of Salix        (ROi recovery 80%)  Feed to NH3-IPA recovery: 380m3/day of Salix (20% ROi reject)
3. Alternate Case  (Working)	Feed to ROi: 1000m3/day of Salix        (ROi recovery 80%)  Feed to NH3-IPA recovery: 190m3/day of Salix (20% ROi reject) + 20m3/day IPA 3.05% and HF 1.54% + 180 m3/day of IPA 6%	Feed to ROi: 2000m3/day of Salix        (ROi recovery 80%)  Feed to NH3-IPA recovery: 380m3/day of Salix (20% ROi reject) + 20m3/day IPA 3.05% and HF 1.54% + 180 m3/day of IPA 6%

PROPOSED CONFIGURATION FOR ROi
NOTE: During maintenance of any individual pumps or membranes, the standby unit will be automatically come into operation mode.

[Table 1]
Tanks	2 Working  (Designed for a total capacity of 2000 m3/day)
Pumps & membranes	1 Working +1 Standby during Phase 1 of 1000 m3/day 1 Working +1 Standby +1 Future during Phase 2 of 2000 m3/day

=== Slide 4 ===
PROPOSED CONFIGURATION FOR
NH3-IPA RECOVERY SYSTEM

[Table 1]
Systems	2 Working  -Designed for a total capacity of 30 m3/hr (15+15)
Stripper & Distillation	Stripper(short-bed)：2 Working+1 Standby  Pre-distillation(short-bed) w/Reboiler：2 Working+1 Standby  NH3 distillation(column)：2 Working IPA distillation(short-bed)：2 Working+1 Standby
HX & Condenser & Receiver & Absorber & Tank	2 Working
Pumps	2 Working +2 Standby

SALIX FEEDWATER QUALITY

[Table 1]
S/N	Parameter	Limitation
1	SiO2	Above 200ppm will affect:  ROi recovery Antiscalant selection is difficult  Increase in IPA recovery system sizing & space
2	NH3-N	Above 1440ppm will affect:  ROi permeate quality of <5ppm May need further treatment like more membranes or degassers unit Additional space
3	TDS	Above 5000ppm will affect:  ROi permeate Conductivity quality of <300 µS/cm ROi recovery Requirement of more membranes Additional space.
4	Fluoride	Above 50ppm will affect:  ROi permeate quality  Requirement of more membranes Additional space Frequent CIP Increased Antiscalant consumption
5	IPA	Above 2000ppm will affect:  Frequent CIP Lower membrane life <1.5 years
