Executive Summary
A combination of 8ppm Aquafloc OC 1035, followed by 4ppm Anionic polymer Cure 950 was able to successfully significantly improve the settling of the sludge.

It is recommended to include two slow mix tanks for polymer mixing.
Cationic Polymer mixing tank
Anionic Polymer mixing tank
Cationic Polymer dosing station
Anionic Polymer dosing station

Effluent from the anionic polymer tank should go to the sludge thickening tank.

As a further improvement, Supernate from the sludge thickening tank can be sent to the TMF, Centrate from the centrifuge can be sent back to either the cationic, anionic, or sludge thickening tank.

Background
Micron Backgrinding wastewater project was having initial problems.
Excessive H2 gas generation, leading to alarms on the portable gas detector
Excessive H2 gas generation, leading to a hot and bubbling wet sludge
Dry solids that tends to create a silica dust that is airborne
Centrifuge had an effluent blockage and generated large solids within the centrifuge
Excessive solids in centrate, leading to choking in TMF
This plant is designed as an improvement of a conventional backgrinding WWTP and treats the backgrinding wastewater without the use of coagulants. The plant was designed with a centrifuge for solids removal due to continuous operation and minimal space available.

=== Slide 6 ===
Polymer Dosage Calculation
Polymers in solid or liquid form were considered 100% purity.
100% polymers were diluted into 0.1% w/w concentration.
200mL of water sample was used for every jar test.
Polymer dosage was calculated.
Eg.

=== Slide 7 ===
Jar Test Protocol
Sample + different Cationic polymer (varied dosages)
Stir at 50/200 rpm for 30 min
After 30 min, add Anionic Polymer (Cure Flocculant) (4ppm)
Stir at 50 rpm for 15 min
After 15 min, allow sludge to settle for 15 min
Collect sludge for centrifuge test at 4,000 rpm for 5 min
