Experimental Procedure
Prepared  fixed concentration of 11.1 Normal  sulfuric acid of 5L volume.
Prepared a fixed concentration of  ~754ppm ammonium hydroxide of 35L
 The pH of the Ammonium solution should be > pH 10 (if pH <10 adjust by adding NaOH).
Carried out the experiment at a flow rate of 380ml/min in both shell and gas side .
Sulphuric acid is recirculated for absorbing the Ammonia
Ammonium hydroxide solution is single pass and spent ammonia is collected in separate tank
Collected the samples at  intervals of 15min and taken for the analysis (change in Nitrogen)
Ammonia is indicated by Nitrogen concentration, measured using TOC analyser

[Table 1]
Batches of 5     5 Lt	Reduction of NH4OH in ppm
Batch 1	139.1
Batch 2	97.9
Batch 3	136.5
Batch 4	148.1
Batch 5	39.9
Batch 6	48.9
Batch 7	68.3

=== Slide 8 ===
Observations
Initial and final volume of Sulphuric acid has not changed.
Colour of the sulphuric acid turned to black from colorless
Initial concentration of acid  11.1N
Final concentration of acid reduced to 9.3N
Final concentration  of Ammonium sulphate solution in sulphuric acid is increased from 75ppm to 13566 ppm

Future Plan:
 I would like to study the effect of increasing the concentration of ammonia solution at different levels, while keeping the concentration of sulfuric acid fixed.
