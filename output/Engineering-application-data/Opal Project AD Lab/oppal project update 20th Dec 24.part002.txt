Biological Lab Testing – Results and next steps Batch 2
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
Current results
Carbon source has been switched to glycerol for the last few days, aerobic degradation works fine
Bacteria are still in the adaptation phase considering glycercol use for denitrification
MLSS concentration seems to stabilise at a slightly lower level

Next steps
Increased use of anoxic phases to kick-start denitrification with glycerol
Next urea feeding only once denitrification gets established

Biological Testing – Batch 1
IPA degradation: Microbe are completely acclimatized to IPA food source, degradation rate is good and its increasing with time, currently 400 to 500 mg/l of COD is degraded, and its rate is increasing as the MLSS is increasing

MLSS: Growth rate is good, today it has reached to 1450 mg/l (from the lowest of 800 mg/l - five days back), its majorly depends on the volume of food is provided, if it is starving then MLSS goes down. With the increase in MLSS concentration, MLVSS ratio will also increase, if MLSS reaches to 2000ppm, the degrading rate and MLVSS ratio will be better

Denitrification: Both nitrification and denitrification process is going well, current cycle the NO3 and NO2 has reduced from 23ppm to 2 ppm and 11ppm to 2ppm respectively, NH3 is getting reduced to NO3 and NO2 during the aerobic period

Overall the Batch reactor is under dynamic mode (nitrification and denitrification) and performing good

Will continue to monitor the studies for another a week or 2 week, so that we can generate complete dynamics of IPA and NH3 degradation
Next coarse of action planned for batch 1
After understanding the complete dynamics, will load TMAH to the reactor incrementally and monitor the dynamics (which will be final objective of the project)

=== Slide 14 ===
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
Biological Testing – Batch 2
IPA degradation: Microbe are getting acclimatized to IPA food source, IPA is getting degraded but not as fast Batch 1 reactor

Glycerin degradation: Started to add glycerin, to see the impact of MLSS and denitrification kinetics, glycerin is getting degraded at faster rate, we have started observing denitrification process, there is reduction in NO3 and NO2 values

MLSS: Growth rate is sustained at ~2500mg/l, anticipating further growth in the colonies

Overall the Batch reactor 2 is under dynamic mode (nitrification and denitrification) and showing positive outcomes for both IPA and glycerin degradation along with denitrification
Next coarse of action planned for batch 2

Will start adding the TMAH incrementally (from 20 ppm to 75ppm) from tomorrow
Glycerin will be added along with TMAH, and will observe the complete Kinetics of nitrification and denitrification

=== Slide 15 ===
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
TMAH Degradation
Protocols to quantify the TMAH degradation
Will be preparing 20ppm to 100ppm TMAH sample (using existing 98% salt)
Will establish the TN, TOC and TKN database for the above TMAH standard
Will evaluate the TN, TOC and TKN values for the combination – 50ppm TMAH + 400ppm of COD from glycerin + 50ppm of NH3 from urea (which is the food source in batch reactor 2)
Will monitor the TN, TOC and TKN value during degradation process
TMAH analysis
will validate the HPLC method carried out by the local lab (will be sending the 50ppm TMAH sample for the validating the results)
If the results are validated and satisfied, will give the actual degraded bioreactor sample (initial and final degraded sample)

If external lab results are not satisfied, will send the sample to Taiwan lab for the TMAH analysis

MLSS Growth rate – IPA as the food source
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
Started with 75 to 100 mg/day of COD reduction

Now, there is a reduction of ~620 mg/day COD reduction

F/M ratio is close to 0.2

MLSS is keep increasing, will take it up to 5000ppm in next 10 to 12 days

=== Slide 19 ===
Status and Observations – TMAH Study
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
1) TMAH degradation is validated by TOC observation
Inferences:
Currently culture is getting acclimatized to TMAH food source, as there is reduction of TOC and it need another 10 to 15  days for complete acclimatization, then we go for understanding the kinetics of degradation including NO3 and NO2 reduction
There is increase in NH3-N in the solution
2) TMAH degradation by observing NH3-N accumulations

Status of the project: carried out all the required studies, closing the studies in this week

Observation and Outcome from the study

Acclimatization of aerobic and anerobic microbes under high saline environment – TDS of ~17gm/l
MLVSS was maintained at 2500 mg/l to 3000 mg/l
Complete Degradation of IPA (400ppm) in 24 hours and TMAH (30ppm) in <48 hours
Conversion of NH3 to NO3 and NO2 under aerobic environment was very good
Further NO3 and NO2 was reduced from the system under Aerobic environment
Demonstrated the continuous degradation and reduction of food sources for a period of 4 months
Bacteria’s was completely adapted to TMAH and IPA food source
Successfully demonstrated both aerobic and an-aerobic studies in a single bio-reactor (Sequential batch studies)
