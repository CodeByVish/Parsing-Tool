Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH)-using bacteria were isolated from soils in a factory which has

produced similar C; compounds with TMAH for 30 years. Four Gram-positive strains (TH-6, TH-30, TH-31
and TH-35) use TMAH easily, and grow in up to 8 wt% TMAH. Two Gram-negative strains (TH-3 and TH-
15) use TMAH weakly, and grow in up to 3 wt% TMAH. The Gram-positive strains belong to the Mcobacte-
rium, Gram-negative TH-3 resembles Pseudomonas aminovorans, and TH-15 belongs to the Methylobacte-
rium from its morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Mycobacterium sp. TH-30 biodegrades 1%
TMAH in a continuous culture with a dilution rate below 0.06 h~ completely. This bacterium seems to be use-
ful for the biodegradation of waste fluids containing TMAH.

Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) 1s synthe- tained by repeating plate culture on the TMAH basal me-
