Inhibition (qPCR) and reverse transcript (RT)-qPCR indicated that Hyphomicrobium sp. may be able to utilize both
TMAH and its degradation intermediates such as trimethylamine (TMA), while Thiobacillus sp. can only
utilize TMAH. The qPCR and RT-qPCR results suggested that TMAH may inhibit nitrification by inactive
expression of amoA gene and the intermediates of TMAH degradation may compete ammonia mono-
oxygenase (AMO) enzyme with ammonia for nitrification inhibition.
