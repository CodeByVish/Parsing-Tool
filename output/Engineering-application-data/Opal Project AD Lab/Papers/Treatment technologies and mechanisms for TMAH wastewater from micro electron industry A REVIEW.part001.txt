ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Keywords: With the advent of Industry 4.0, the micro-electronic industry has become one of the fastest-growing industries
Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) worldwide. As a result, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) wastewater, as the typical wastewater from

Recovery the mechanisms of TMAH wastewater treatment is still lacking. This paper systematically reviewed the mech-
Mechanism anisms of TMAH treatment using various processes, including recovery processes and degradation processes. The
recovery mechanisms of TMAH included cation exchange under the electrostatic attraction for adsorption,
directed migration of TMA and OH_ driven by electrodes for electrodialysis, etc. The degradation mechanisms
of TMAH included methanogenic TMAH degradation, TMAH-oxidative methylotrophic degradation, and
demethylation and oxidation. The results highlighted that both hybrid recovery and treatment processes
exhibited the most efficient recovery and removal of TMAH. Future research on TMAH wastewater treatment
should focus on energy metabolism, electron transfer, and co-digestion of biodegradation, efficient novel ma-
terials for TMAH recovery and degradation, and appropriate hybrid recovery and treatment processes for
resource reuse of TMAH wastewater. Ultimately, the possible pathways for the resource reuse of TMAH
wastewater were also proposed.

With the advent of Industry 4.0, the micro-electronic industry has Meanwhile, as the chip process becomes more advanced, the water
