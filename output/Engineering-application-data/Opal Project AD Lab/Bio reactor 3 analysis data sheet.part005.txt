	General procedure Monday, Wednesday, Friday morning:					 	 	 	(2) Mix separately into 20 % of volume		 	 	 		pH is 9.5 and adjusted to 7.5 using HCl acid
	- Measure all parameters					 	 	 	(3) Mix separately into 10 % of volume		 	 	 
	- Let sludge settle					 	 	 	(4) Mix separately into the remaining volume		 	 	 
	- Remove supernatant 10 - 20 %					 	 	 	Probably you have to increase pH to make it soluble and then decrease again.
	- Replace with fresh brine and add IPA + urea as needed					 	 	 	That will add some additional salt, but it is okay if it is not too much. 				 
	- Measure all parameters again					 	 	 	If you manage to dissolve without pH changes, that is fine (just a suggestion).
	- If IPA has been added, put batch in anoxic mode for 3 h (until you go home)								Afterwards, you can combine all solutions.
