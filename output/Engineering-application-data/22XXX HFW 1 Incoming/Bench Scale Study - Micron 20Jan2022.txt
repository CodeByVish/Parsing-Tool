Jar testing Procedure
To each testing jar, pour in 1L of wastewater sample*
To each jar, dose in 5000, 6000, 7000 mg/L of Ca(OH)2 and rapid mix (300 rpm) for 30s, Slow mix (100 rpm) for 30 min, measure pH every 10 min*
Dose 1mg/L for each of the AN934 polymer (anionic) in each jar and further slower mix (60 rpm) for 30 min. Measure pH every 10 min*
Stop mixing and leave the solids to settle over 60 min*
Observe sludge settling and measure sludge height every 15 min (if applicable)
Measure turbidity of supernatant and collect the sludge
For the jar with the lowest supernatant turbidity reading, filter out the supernatant through 0.45 um filter and send for analysis and collect the sludge generated
For the sludge collected, filter out using 1.5 µm filter. Collect the sludge, dry sample for XRF analysis.
*take photo for report

Result - NF filtration of HFW+NH4F with IPA (without pH adjustment) – Trial 2
Operating conditions

Batch mode (using Trisep TS40 NF membrane)

75% recovery

100 psi operating pressure, increased pressure over time as feed gets more and more concentrated
