=== Slide 1 ===
Jar testing Procedure
To each testing jar, pour in 1L of wastewater sample
To each jar, dose in 4000 - 7000 mg/L of Ca(OH)2 and rapid mix for 30s
Slow mix for 30 min, measure pH every 15 min
Dose 1mg/L for each of the AN905 polymer (anionic) in each jar and further slower mix (30 rpm) for 30 min. Measure pH every 15 min
Stop mixing and leave the solids to settle over 60 min
Observe sludge settling and measure sludge height every 15 min (if applicable)
Measure turbidity of supernatant and collect the sludge
For the jar with the lowest supernatant turbidity reading, filter out the supernatant through 0.45 um filter and send for analysis and collect the sludge generated
For the sludge collected, filter out using 1.5 µm filter. Collect the sludge, dry sample for XRF analysis.

Summary
Fluoride level was effectively reduced to <10 ppm by Scheme 1 (Lime dosage: 4000 ppm) and Scheme 2a and 2b (2-step chemical precipitation with 2500ppm and 1000ppm of CaCl2 for 1st step and 2nd step respectively).

Scheme 3 (CaCl2 dosing and lime dosing for pH adjustment) was found less effective in removing fluoride in HFW. The fluoride level remain slightly above 10 ppm with maximum dosage of  2500 ppm CaCl2 and 800 ppm of Ca(OH)2.

2nd Step precipitation is recommended for Scheme 3 for Fluoride removal.

XRF analysis would be done to ensure the purity of CaF2 is above 75% to meet requirement specified by Micron.
