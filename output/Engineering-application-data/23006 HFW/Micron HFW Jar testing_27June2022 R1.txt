=== Slide 4 ===
Base case experiment
3 beakers of 250 ml each of HFW feedwater is considered


Once dosed, allow rapid mixing for 30s, & followed by Slow mixing for 45 min
Dose 1 mg/L of SNF polymer (anionic) for each jars and further slower mix (60 rpm) for 45 min
Stop mixing and leave the solids to settle over 60 min, allow sludge settling
All supernatant was collected for analysis

[Table 1]
Case 1 Dosage	Case 2 Dosage	Case 3 Dosage
pH adjusted to 8 + 3500 mg/L CaCl2	pH adjusted to 8 + 4000 mg/L CaCl2	pH adjusted to 8 + 4500 mg/L CaCl2
