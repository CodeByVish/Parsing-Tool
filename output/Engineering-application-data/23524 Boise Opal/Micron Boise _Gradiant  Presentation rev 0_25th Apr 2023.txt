Objectives of lab trials
The objectives of the present study

 To identify the maximum recovery that can be able to achieve through the ROi stage 1 & CFRO stage 2

To determine the dosage of chemicals required for SCE stage 1  and stage 2 that is needed to bring down Silica, Hardness, and fluoride levels to the required concentrations.

=== Slide 6 ===
Experimental procedures
Prepared synthetic water according to the feed water parameters

Performed water analysis using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Ion Chromatography (IC), and other techniques to confirm feed water parameters

Performed membrane and antiscalant projections to predict maximum recovery

Identified the initial chemical dosages through the OLI and other software

Jar Testing protocols (FeCl3)
A beaker of 500ml of synthetic water is dosed with different concentrations of FeCl3
Once dosed, the mixture was rapidly mixed (200 rpm) for the 30s, & followed by slow mixing (100 rpm) for 45 min, pH was measured and adjusted to 8.5 every 15 min
Mixing was stopped and the solids were left to settle for over 90 min, allowing the sludge to settle
The supernatant and sludge were collected for analysis

=== Slide 10 ===

Conclusion/summary
Successfully achieved the target concentration of brine >230000 mg/l using ROi stage 1 and stage 2 membrane technology.
Met the reclaimed treated water quality: <75 mg/L of TDS.
Identified the optimized dosage of chemicals to reduce the scaling and maximize the recovery.
Conducted the Adiabatic chiller, CGE, and ATFD/centrifuge experiments to validate the sodium sulfate-rich salts and mixed salts.

Foam fractionation - Separation
It is the state-of-the-art technology that uses adsorption-based technique to create many air-liquid interfaces within the solution to achieve PFAS removal. The surface-active PFAS compounds will be adsorbed onto these air-liquid interfaces and separated from waste stream.

Benefits
Foam fractionation has the potential to achieve more than 10X concentration factor (equivalent to > 90% volume reduction of waste stream for downstream EO destruction step) at a fraction of the cost compared to other conventional PFAS removal technologies.
Fig.2. OPEX ($/m3) comparison among other PFAS removal technologies.
Benefits:

Simpler to O&M & modularization
Easier deployment
Low chemical consumption
Low energy requirement
Low competition with co-contaminants
