SCE stage 2: Jar Testing protocols
A beaker of 500ml of synthetic water is dosed with different concentrations of lime, MgCl2, and Na2CO3
Once the dosage of both was, the mixture was rapidly mixed (200 rpm) for the 30s, & followed by slow mixing (100 rpm) for 45 min, and pH was measured and adjusted to 10.5 every 15 min
1 mg/L of SNF polymer (anionic) was dosed and further slower mix (30 rpm) for 45 min. pH was measured every 15 min
Mixing was stopped and the solids were left to settle for over 90 min, allowing the sludge to settle
The supernatant and sludge were collected for analysis

Foam fractionation - Separation
It is the state-of-the-art technology that uses adsorption-based technique to create many air-liquid interfaces within the solution to achieve PFAS removal. The surface-active PFAS compounds will be adsorbed onto these air-liquid interfaces and separated from waste stream.

Benefits:

Simpler to O&M & modularization
Easier deployment
Low chemical consumption
