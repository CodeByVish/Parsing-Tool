IPA/Water mixtures freezing point curve
Micron WW stream contains 15371 mg/l of IPA
At low temperatures concentrated IPA will have higher density
ICE density 0.92

Flow Scheme Option 1 – Low temperature crystallization
LT Reactor – Low Temperature crystallization (-4C)*
AC - Alcohol Concentrator (RO)
Polishing – RO and wash with permeate
IPA – Isopropyl Alcohol

Process Description – Single/Double stage IPA Con.
Pre-cool the WW stream using plate frame/shell & tube HXs to a desired temperature.
Reactor should maintain the temperature below the theoretical value (-4C)
Based on the density the IPA and Ice will separate. If required, use the centrifuge for the solid/liquid separation.
IPA can be further concentrated using the 2nd stage reactor with low temperature crystallization or using the RO/CFRO membranes.
Ice can be crushed in a crusher before it is going to heat exchange with the incoming WW stream.
Wash water can be used for the polishing/washing of ice to remove the surface impurities.
Chillers and centrifuges are available for the given temperature.

Micron IPA WW - Freezer study
Performed the freezer study using the Micron IPA WW.
Test procedure:
Collected known volume of (100 ml) WW sample
Kept inside the lab freezer overnight.
Observed the Ice formation along with Concentrated IPA in the liquid form.
Collected concentrated IPA in a separate vial.
Washed the ICE  and collected the washed liquid.
Kept ICE for melting.
Analysed sample for the COD, TDS.
Visual observation shows that good separation between two layers.
