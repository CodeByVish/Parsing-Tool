Jar testing Procedure
To each testing jar, pour in 1L of wastewater sample
To each jar, dose in 7000/7500/8000 mg/L of Ca(OH)2 and rapid mix for 30s
Slow mix for 30 min, measure pH every 10 min
Dose 1mg/L for each of the SNF polymer (anionic) in each jar and further slower mix (30 rpm) for 30 min. Measure pH every 20 min
Stop mixing and leave the solids to settle over 60 min
Observe sludge settling and measure sludge height every 5 min (if applicable)
Measure turbidity of supernatant and collect the sludge
For the jar with the lowest supernatant turbidity reading, filter out the supernatant through 0.45 um filter and send for analysis and collect the sludge generated
For the sludge collected, filter out using 1.5 µm filter. Collect the sludge, dry sample for XRD analysis. Meanwhile, dissolve a pre-determined amount of collected sludge in acid and send for analysis

Conclusions
Following conclusions are made based on several RO/NF projections, bench scale testing and PHREEQC models

UF, NF and SWRO will be sufficient for generating required water quality for cooling tower and local scrubbers. Recovery ratio between 55-60%.
Lower pH will be helpful to get higher membrane rejections. No scaling issues with lower Ph. Conventional membranes can be used for pH between 2-12, specialty membranes may be required for lower Ph.
Mixed/NF +SWRO reject for removal of Fluoride (by coagulation, flocculation, clarification, sedimentation, filter press) looks a suitable configuration.
Lime and CaCl2 combination or higher amount of lime will be enough for the removal of fluoride to meet the discharge water quality.
Sludge will contain more than 80% of CaF2. if in case phosphates are higher, then sludge quality will differ. XRD results shows the major peak is CaF2.
NF will be having tolerance to the organics. Experiments are on going to validate the % IPA rejections.
Optimization of chemical dosage/conditions can be done during detailed engineering design
