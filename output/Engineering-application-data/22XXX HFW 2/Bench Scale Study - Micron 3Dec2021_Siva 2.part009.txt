Conclusions
Following conclusions are made based on several RO/NF projections, bench scale testing and PHREEQC models

UF, NF and SWRO will be sufficient for generating required water quality for cooling tower and local scrubbers. Recovery ratio between 55-60%.
Lower pH will be helpful to get higher membrane rejections. No scaling issues with lower pH. Conventional membranes will be used for pH between 2 to 12
Mixed/NF +SWRO reject for removal of Fluoride (by coagulation, flocculation, clarification, sedimentation, filter press) looks a suitable configuration.
Lime and CaCl2 combination or higher amount of lime will be enough for the removal of fluoride to meet the discharge water quality.
Sludge will contain more than 80% of CaF2. if in case phosphates are higher, then sludge quality will differ. XRD results shows the major peak is CaF2.
NF will be having tolerance to the organics. Experiments are on going to validate the % IPA rejections.
Optimization of chemical dosage/conditions can be done during detailed engineering design
