Jar testing Procedure
2 *400ml of RO reject is considered as Case 1 & Case 2
Case 1 – 4000mg of Ca(OH)2 in 400ml
Case 2 is 2400mg/l of Ca(OH)2 & 1600mg/l of CaCl2
Once dosed, allow rapid mixing for 30s, & followed by Slow mixing for 30 min, measure pH every 10 min
Dose 0.4mg/L of SNF polymer (anionic) for each jars and further slower mix (30 rpm) for 30 min. Measure pH every 20 min
Stop mixing and leave the solids to settle over 60 min, allow sludge settling
Measure turbidity of supernatant and collect the sludge
For the jar with the lowest supernatant turbidity reading, filter out the supernatant through 0.45um filter and send for analysis and collect the sludge generated
For the sludge collected, filter out using 1.5 μm filter. Collect the sludge, dry sample for XRD analysis.
