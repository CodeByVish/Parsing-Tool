Reverse osmosis (RO) vs semi-batch RO (SBRO)
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
SBRO
The process operates in cycles and water is filtered through the membrane until a certain concentration, after which the system is flushed, and new cycle begins
More efficient use of energy due to the operation in batch cycles
Offers higher recovery rates and lower brine production
RO
Continuous process where water is forced through a semi permeable membrane
High pressure is required throughout the process due to operation in a steady state
Produces a significant amount of brine and recovery is limited with single stage operation

[Table 1]
Parameter	Conventional RO	Semi-batch RO
Continuous operation	Yes	Partially, it involves a flushing cycle
Water flow	Continuous	Intermittent
System complexity	Lower	Moderate, with recirculation pump and additional control valve
Energy consumption	Constant (unless with fouling/scaling)	Could be reduced during the service cycle
Product water quality	Consistent	Vary within cycles
Reject production	Continuous reject production	Reject produced during flushing step
Footprint	Large with high recovery	Relatively smaller even with high recovery
Cleaning frequency	More frequent	Less frequent due to semi-batch flushing

Comparison of RO vs SBRO – same feed flow = 90 m3/h, different flux
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
Key findings:
The RO production (product flow) at 56% recovery is lower than that at 93.1 % recovery
Energy consumption at 93.1% recovery = RO-CR100 > RO-AQ > SBRO-CR100 > SBRO-AQ
The energy consumption is ~30% lower for SBRO compared to RO
Aquamembranes can save ~22% energy in the SBRO process compared to the Dupont membrane → AQ is operating at lower flux (same feed flowrate) due to the larger membrane area → this leads to higher permeate TDS for AQ
Impractical to operate RO at 93% recovery due to the infinite amount of CIP (due to scaling of CaF2 and SiO2) needed per year as compared to SBRO
SBRO shows lesser CIP frequency due to the semi-batch flushing after each service cycle
‡RO and SBRO projection is carried out with 17 PV x 6 Element

[Table 1]
	RO – 56 % recovery Product flow = 50.4 m3/hr					RO – 93% recovery Product flow = 83.7 m3/h					SBRO – 93% recovery Product flow = 83.7 m3/h

=== Slide 11 ===
Comparison of RO vs SBRO – Same flux, higher feed flow
GRADIANT CONFIDENTIAL
‡RO and SBRO projection is carried out with 17 PV x 6 Element
Key findings:
The RO energy consumption at 56% recovery is the same at the same flux for CR100 and AQ
Energy consumption at 93% recovery = RO-CR100 ≈ RO-AQ > SBRO-CR100 ≈ SBRO-AQ
Operation at higher flux for AQ improves the permeate quality
The energy consumption is similar for both CR100 and AQ due to the operation at high flux for AQ

[Table 1]
	RO – 56% recovery  Flux = 13.3 LMH						RO – 93% recovery  Flux = 22.6 LMH						SBRO – 93% recovery  Flux = 22.6 LMH

At the same permeate flux, the max operating pressure for both the membrane is around ~15 bar
Due to the larger membrane area of Aquamembrane, the operating flux is lower at the same permeate flowrate → lower operating pressure compared to CR100-4040

=== Slide 21 ===
Summary
Aquamembranes generally shows a lower energy consumption than CR100
However, the permeate fluoride of Aquamembranes does not meet the KPI of <15 mg/L from most of the cases
The 4040 membrane is hand-rolled in Aquamembranes and does not truly representing the 8040 membrane elements
The performance of AQ 8040 membrane elements would need to be verified with on-site testing
